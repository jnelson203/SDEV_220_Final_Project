# Goodwill Inventory Management System

## Overview
The **Goodwill Inventory Management System** is a Python-based application designed to help manage the inventory of items for a non-profit organization like Goodwill. The system allows staff members to add, update, remove, and view inventory items. It also provides the ability to generate reports in CSV format and view an overall inventory summary, including the total number of items and the total value of the inventory.

The system is designed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and includes a graphical user interface (GUI) built with **Tkinter**. The core of the application includes three main components:
- **Inventory Management**: Handles adding, updating, removing, and displaying inventory items.
- **Report Generation**: Generates CSV reports for inventory items and summaries of inventory status.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Provides an easy-to-use interface for interacting with the inventory system.
